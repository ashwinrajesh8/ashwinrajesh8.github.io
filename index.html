            Hi! My name is Ashwin and I'm a Computer Science student @ SMU 
            with minors in Business Administration & Economics.
          </p>
          <br>

        <div class=col-3>
          <p>
            Before coming to SMU, I spent ~10 years overseas in Malaysia where I completed
            both high school and middle school. My hobbies/interests include:
          <!-- </p> -->
          <ol>
            <li>Travelling</li>
            <li>Table Tennis</li>
            <li>FinTech</li>
            <li>Software Projects</li>
            <li>Cloud Computing</li>
          </ol>
          <!-- <p> -->
            I have had the opportunity to travel to 40 countries with family and friends, and I look forward to continuing as the pandemic slows down.
            While in Malaysia, I underwent training for local club Table Tennis.
            I first got into FinTech back in 2016 when I was able to acquire Bitcoin. I was 14 and I didn't quite understand the tech just yet, but I desperately wanted to be a part of it. My first transaction, I recieved $0.02 (price was around $400 per coin back then) which has since become a little over $2.00.
            Since then I have enjoyed participating in projects to futher my knowledge in the area and contribute to building better financial infrastructure. I also hope to learn more about implementing open banking within our financial system.
            I also have been involved in cloud research at the AT&T Center for Virtualization and look forward to expanding my knowledge of the industry.
